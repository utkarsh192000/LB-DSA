1) What is Macro ?
    A piece of code in Program that is replaced by a value 

2) Global Variable Concept ??

-> we can share variable through reference variable
-> local variable is only accessible inside that function / or a block  ; it dies outside that function
-> global variable has a global scope ; it is accessible every where inside a program ; be it 
    main() , func1() , func(int a) .......
    
-> global variable definition is not a good practice ; as it can be updated easily ; 
    ; also it will need a space in open 
-> it is better to use refernce varible thing 

3) Inline Function Concept ??
-> It is just a function usually of 1-2 line statement ; which dont take space in function call stack 


4) Default Argument Concept ??
    -> if any argument in function declaration is passed as default argument , then if no value 
        is passed as parameter during function call , then it will take default value of it
